# Work Day Scheduler
*"A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day"*

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler provides an efficient way to plan & keep track of your daily working schedule for the current day in hand. 

A browser-based app that enables the user to plan their working day effectively through assigning work activities to hourly time blocks, thereby creating a full day schedule of planned work activities.

Work Day Scheduler utilises local storage in the browser so that user activities 'persist' and are not lost when the page is refreshed/reloaded.

*The screenshot below depicts a typical working day for a web development student using the Work Day Scheduler to plan for their studies. The developer console is visible at the lower section of the screenshot, demonstrating the key:value pairs for each time block as set once each 'save button' has been pressed to commit the respective activities to the schedule*

## Usage
Time blocks represent typical working hours and are colour coded depending on what time it is, time blocks for past hours in the day appear grey & time blocks ahead of the current time appear green, the time block representing the current time will appear red.

* Simply 'click' the cursor over a time block and type in the activity you wish to add for that time block.
* Then 'click' the save button to commit the activity to the scheduler for the specific time block that you've typed the activity in.
* Repeat the process for each time block with whichever activities that you are planning for the day.
* You can overwrite planned activities by amending &/or replacing the existing text and 'clicking' the save button once again (*you can repeat this process as many times you wish, making it ideal where plans may changes quickly within your working day*).
