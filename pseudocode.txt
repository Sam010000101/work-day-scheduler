Action Plan


The app should:

    1. Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.

    2. Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

    3. Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

    4. Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

    5. Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

    6. Persist events between refreshes of a page
    - refer to client side storage slides & examples (6.3)
